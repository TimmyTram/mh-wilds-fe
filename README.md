# Monster Hunter Wilds Wiki

## Overview:
The Monster Hunter Wilds Wiki, is a web application built that helps centralize data including Monster Drop Tables, Weakness, Armor Sets and much more all in one, user friendly website.

### Motivation:
Monster Hunter Wilds is known for not having the best UI/UX experience when it comes to finding information regarding Monster Drop Chances, Monster Sizes, Weaknesses, and overall a pain to navigate as information is either omitted or hidden under multiple tabs.

Using the [Monster Hunter Wilds API](https://github.com/LartTyler/mhdb-wilds), I sought to create my own website that compiles all the information that I think is important into a simple web application that is responsive on both desktop and mobile screens utilizing the power of TailwindCSS.

### Additional Features:
1. The [Monster Hunter Wilds API](https://github.com/LartTyler/mhdb-wilds) provides Data in multiple languages, as such the website supports up to **10 Languages.**
2. A Light mode and Dark mode toggle for user's with different preferences.
3. An API Status Page that lets people know if the API is down.

### Stack:
- React
- Next.JS 15
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript
